personal project
est. 04/06/2023

# overview
learning the ins and outs of winapi
so obviously it only works on windows right now
im on windows 10

and listen bro its gonna be in english bro so if you put weird esoteric
characters in here im not taking responsibility for what happens to you ...
you put that on yourself
but it shouldn't do anything bad regardless...


# note
if you want to compile it yourself and you are noticeably a windows user ...
`g++ window.cpp -o exerciser -DUNICODE -lgdi32`
